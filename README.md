# OVENSensorReader

THIS VERSION IS DEPRECATED. SEE ModbusSensorUtility REPOSITORY.

The app reads and displays input registers of OVEN modules: ОВЕН MB110-220.8AC, ОВЕН MB110-224.8A
It is possible to add other models. Communication goes with Modbus RTU master via Serial Port. The ReadHoldingRegisters() function is used. The app works asynchronously.
